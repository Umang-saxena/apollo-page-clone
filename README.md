**Sample Request using Postman:**

1. Open Postman.
2. Create a new GET request.
3. Enter the URL:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/list-doctor-with-filter
   ```
4. In the "Params" tab, add the following key-value pairs as query parameters:

   - `experience`: `5`
   - `fees`: `100`

{
  "doctors": [
    {
      "_id": "1234567890abcdef",
      "name": "Dr. John Doe",
      "speciality": "General Physician",

    }
    // more doctor objects
  ],
  "totalPages": 5
}
```

## Testing the API

You can test the API endpoint using tools like curl, Postman, or your browser by sending GET requests with appropriate query parameters as shown above.

## Notes

- Ensure your backend server is running before making API requests.
- The frontend uses the API to fetch and display doctors with filters applied.
